This is a text file with some notes about APIs.

An API endpoint is a path to a function behind an API that returns some values with a specified input.

In the case of our example API this is the endpoint for gathering a joke:
https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any

Although this API has many paths for this endpoint to gather different types of jokes:
https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming

In order to specify a parameter than modifies our output we need to use the question mark char:
https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?type=single

An in order to use multiple parameters we must separate them using an ampersand:
https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?type=single&contains=Machine%20learning
