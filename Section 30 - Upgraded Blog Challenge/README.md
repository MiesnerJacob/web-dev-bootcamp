This project is an upgrade of the blog website we built in Section 23. This version of the blog website has a MongoDB database associated with it to ensure that the data can persist after reloading and restarting. The MongoDB I will use here will be a local instance but we could just as easily hook it up to MongoDB Atlas and deploy the app via Heroku to have it be a cloud-hosted application.
