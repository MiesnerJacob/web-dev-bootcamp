# web-dev-bootcamp

Over the past 4 years, I have embarked on a journey to become a Data Scientist. Through this experience, I have taken many courses, completed many projects, and built features and production, ML models. 

In the next career phase, I would like to be a more well-rounded programmer with a complete understanding of front-end web dev, back-end dev, etc. This beginner Web development course will be the start of my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer who also has Data Science skills (statistical methods, machine learning modeling & deployment).
